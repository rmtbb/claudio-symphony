# Claudio Symphony

Claudio turns Claude Code hook events into soft, in-key ambient music. It's installed as a plugin (hooks already wired) or via `./bin/claudio install`. The `claudio` CLI is on PATH when the plugin is active; otherwise call `./bin/claudio` from the repo.

## Most common things people ask for

- **Open the visual console** (the thing to look at): `claudio web` — a live constellation of glowing "voices" with 5 physics view modes, preset browser, mic-jam, and recording. Runs locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8788`.
- **Change the sound / vibe**: `claudio preset use <name>` (e.g. `meadow`, `cathedral`, `rainfall`, `koto`, `studio`). List them with `claudio preset list`; hear them with `claudio audition`.
- **Make it quieter / off**: `claudio volume 0.3`, or `claudio off` / `claudio on`.
- **Turn on the drone bed**: `claudio drone on` (only some presets have one — `cathedral` does). It follows the key live.
- **Record a clip to share**: `claudio record 30` (saves to `recordings/`), or hit **Rec** in `claudio web`.
- **Jam with it**: open `claudio web`, hit **🎤 Listen**, and hum — it re-keys to your note. Headphones + Options → Mic monitor lets you play through its reverb.

## If it's silent

1. `claudio status` — shows whether it's on, the active preset, and whether hooks are wired.
2. Samples render on first use. If a brand-new plugin install is silent, check `logs/SETUP_NEEDED.txt` — it usually means numpy is missing: `python3 -m pip install numpy`, then start a new session.
3. Make sure it isn't muted (`claudio on`) and master volume is up.

## Full command reference

`claudio` with no args (or `claudio --help`) prints every command — per-voice tuning, event→sound mapping, scales, chord progressions, the MIDI jukebox, session replay, and directory routing rules. Prefer the web console (`claudio web`) for anything visual or exploratory.
